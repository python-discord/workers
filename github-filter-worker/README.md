# 👷GitHub Filter Worker

This worker filters out noise events from GitHub webhooks generated by tools like dependabot.

This is particularly useful when relaying embeds to Discord when the embed sizes are huge and convey no information.

This tool is built at the moment only to handle Discord webhooks.

## Deployment

You need to install `wrangler` with `npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler`.

Once you've installed this run `wrangler login`.

After you've authorised, you can make modifications to the worker and run `wrangler publish` to push them to the edge.

## Usage

Once the worker is active on a domain simply add a GitHub webhook pointing to `https://example.com/{webhook_id}/{webhook_token}`.

All events will be proxied to that hook (providing they don't come from a bot).
